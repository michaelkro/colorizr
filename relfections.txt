1.  How does your gem take advantage of Ruby's metaprogramming capabilities?

    I dynamically created all the color methods using define_method

2.  How long did you spend working on this project?

    About a day

3.  What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

    When I first tried to code the sample_colors class method, I ran into some
    trouble with my loop.  Specifically, I did not know how to deal with an array
    populated with methods, and even after doing some research on the web, I could
    not figure out where I was going wrong.  So I stepped away from the project and
    later, when I was thinking about the lesson, I realized that the send method
    might be the way to go, and it worked!  And then of course, everything started
    to make perfect sense.

4.  Where do you have room to grow?

    I definitely need more practice writing documentation and README files.
